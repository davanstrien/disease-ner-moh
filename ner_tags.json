Act 2 THE Urban District Council of Acton. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER, FOR THE YEAR 1894. ACTON: Printed by J. Knowles, Market Place & Hooper's Mews. The Urban District Council of Acton. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE YEAR 1894. To the Chairman & Members of the Acton District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you the required Annual Report of the Health and Sanitary progress of Acton for the year 1894, but as I have only held office since Oct. 23rd, I have had to rely on my predecessor for much valuable information in its compilation. With regard to Meteorological Observations, the Autumn of the year was remarkable for an excessive rainfall, the result was a disasterous flood in the Thames Valley, which rendered the water turbid and overcharged with organic matter, this placed a great strain on the filtering beds of the various Water Companies, but on the subsidence of the flood the water soon regained its normal condition. 4 Among the chief works of Sanitary importance is the erection in the grounds of the Sewage Works of a Lyons' Patent Steam Disinfector by which all infected beds, bedding and clothing are subjected to super-heated steam, experiments have conclusively proved that steam at 2120 destroys all contagia. The new Burial Ground has been opened in the Northern district of the Parish. It is situated on the East side of Horn Lane. The widening of the High Street has been completed, and the benefit to the Town is apparent, a large fresh air inlet being thus provided. The question of providing a Hospital for Infectious Diseases still remains in abeyance, and I would suggest this matter should engage your early attention. I take this opportunity of suggesting the erection of a Destructor Furnace, fitted with a fume Cremator, by which the dust bin refuse, including vegetable organic matter, can be completely destroyed, without the production of any nuisance ia the neighbourhood of the Destructor. Under the present system the difficulty of dealing with this rubbish is becoming daily more apparent. There was an epidemic of Measles during the Spring, necessitating closing of the Schools, and causing thirteen deaths of children under five years from Bronchitis and Pneumonia. Many of the poorer class look upon Measles as a trivial disease, and ia many cases never seek Medical advice, whereas the patients 5 require the greatest care to prevent the serious lung complications that may supervene. I am pleased to state that the death rate is the lowest since 1890, and the zymotic lower than the two preceeding years. You will notice that as usual the infant mortality is very high, no less than 133 deaths under one year, a death rate of 159.4 per thousand births. From the certificates sent in the majority of deaths under one year are from improper feeding, and 1 have made some further remarks in this report to show how this evil may to a certain extent be mitigated. POPULATION. In the middle of 1894, the population was estimated to be 27,600, an increase of 1,600 since the middle of 1893. The following table shows the number of the population and the inhabited houses at the four preceeding censuses. Year. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1861. 610 3,151 1871. 1,568 8,306 1881. 2,844 17,110 1891. 4,084 24,207 BIRTHS. Total number of births registered was 834, as against 831 in 1893, an increase of 3, Birth Rate 30.2 per thousand persons living, as against 31.9 in 1893. 6 DEATHS. The number registered throughout the year was 393; this includes 25 residents of Acton who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish. They comprised 187 Males and 206 Females. The annual death rate calculated upon a population of 27,600 was 14 2 per thousand, as against 18.6 in 1893, the lowest since 1890. There were 19 inquests held. The average death rate for London was 17.4 per thousand, against 21.1, 20-3 and 20.9 in the three preceding years. The following table shows the various ages at which death occurred in the District. Under 1 year 134 ... Under 5 191 1 year and under 5 57 5 ,, ,, 15 13 ... Over 5 202 15 ,, ,, 25 18 25 ,, ,, 65 107 65 and upwards 64 393 393 The following table compares the death rate of children under one year per thousand registered births, and the birth rate for the last eight years. 7 Birth Rate Per Thousand.

It is especially a difficult subject to approach with regard to the poor women, who are at work all day and leave the infant to the care of children, or possibly some equally ignorant person. The plan that I have adopted is to give printed cards to the mothers and nurses as to the character and amount of food to be given at each meal, also minute directions how to prepare the food, and the suitable feeding bottle to be used. In some cases I find it necessary to instruct them personally in their homes, and not to lose sight of the infant until it begins to thrive. 8 It is calculated that 26,000 children die in London alone from improper feeding, and the mortality of children under 10 years is only 2 per cent. less than it was 50 years ago. Of 50,000 persons dying annually in London, 21,000 are children under that age. ZYMOTIC DEATH RATE. The District is conveniently divided into six divisions with a view of grouping the deaths from the principle Zymotic diseases. Acton. South Acton. Acton Green. East Acton. Willesden. Bedford Park. Total Deaths 189 97 67 7 1 7 Deaths from Zymotic diseases 33 16 13 — 1 — The total number of deaths registered for the principle zymotic diseases was 63, as compared with 89 in 1893, this gives a zymotic death rate of 2.2 per thousand, as compared with 3.4 in 1893. In the following table the death rate and zymotic death rate are so arranged that comparison can be made for the last seven years. It will be noticed that the death rate is the lowest since 1890, and the zymotic lower than the two preceeding years. 9  1888. 1889. 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894.

There have been no deaths from Small Pox, fifteen deaths from Measles, 13 of which were children under 5 years of age who succumbed to lung complications. Three deaths from Scarlet Fever, and 5 from Diphtheria were registered, one of these occurred at the West London Hospital, the others as isolated cases in different parts of the Parish. 10 Whooping Cough was, next to Diarrhoea, the most fatal cause of death, 17 dying therefrom. It is believed to be a Micro-Paristic disease, the poison of which more especially affects the nervous system, with few exceptions the sufferers are solely children and persons of tender years. I think it is the duty of the Medical Officer to see that on recovery or death the clothing, and the room with its contents are properly disinfected. It is very satisfactory to note only 2 deaths from Typhoid Fever, one at Willesden and the other a child under 5 in Acton Parish. Diarrhoea carried off 17 persons, 13 being children under 5 years of age, and improper feeding was the primary cause in many cases. Puerperal Fever caused 4 deaths, but only one case was notified to the Medical Officer. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. There was 167 cases notified as against 340 in 1893, the following table gives the number reported each year since the act came into force. 11  1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894.

Both cases of Small Pox notified were sent to Hospital, they were imported into the District. SCARLET FEVER. This disease has not been nearly so prevalent this year as in 1893. DIPHTHERIA. Twenty-two cases were notified. In a. considerable number of cases the Diagnosis between Diphtheria, Follicular Tonsillitis, and the severest forms of Scarlet Fever without rash is exceedingly difficult, and it is now generally admitted that the Diagonosis in some cases can only be definitely settled by 12 bacteriological examination, hence, many cases that are notified as Diphtheria turn out to be Follicular Tonsillitis, and vice versa. I think that when there is any suspicion, the fact should be notified to the Medical Officer, the case can then be isolated until the diagnosis is clear. TYPHOID FEVER. Fifteen cases were notified, and in some of these defective drainage was discovered, and the action of the District Council to see the defects remedied was immediately taken. PUERPERAL FEVER. Only one case was notified. SUMMARY OF SANITARY WORK.
